🌟 Pleased to share my latest project on computer vision using artificial intelligence! 🌟

In this project, I developed a system to segment images, preparing them for subsequent enhancement. Using Python in JupyterLab, I focused on accurately dividing images into meaningful parts to facilitate later improvements.

🔍 Project Highlights:
Image Segmentation: Dividing images into segments for further enhancement.
Tools Used: Python and JupyterLab for implementation.
This project has significantly enhanced my skills in computer vision and AI. Stay tuned for an example image demonstrating the segmentation process!
